\title{Get aggregated weekly state-level data from covidtracking.com}
\usage{
get_weekly_state_dat(absent_negs = "remove")
}
\arguments{
\item{absent_negs}{A character vector controlling what is done with rows in which negative case counts
aren't reported. This must be one of the strings \code{"remove"} (default) or \code{"collapse"}.}
}
\value{
A data frame grouped by state. Contains weekly aggregated counts of positive tests, negative tests, death, and hospitalizations.
If the default argument \code{"remove"} of \code{absent_negs} is chosen, rows without negative incidence data in a given state are removed, along with the first
row in which negative cases ARE reported (because we don't know if this represents a "catchup" count or not). If the argument
\code{"collapse"} is chosen, the sum of the positive cases over those dates is added to the number of positive cases in the next date which does contain negative incidence.
The t0 column for a given state represents the day before "reliable" data started being collected, which depends on which argument was chosen for
dealing with \code{absent_negs}.
